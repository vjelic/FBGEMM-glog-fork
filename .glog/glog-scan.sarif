Additionally, there is no explicit guard to ensure that the source is not null, which increases the risk of undefined behavior. The use of a fixed size (sizeof(float)) does not mitigate the risk of overlapping memory regions. While the source is not a string literal or constant, which would reduce the likelihood of overlap, the overlap is still feasible according to the analysis. Therefore, this is a genuine case of potential undefined behavior due to overlapping memory regions in a memory copy operation.\n\n## In Context Remediation\nTo prevent undefined behavior caused by overlapping memory regions in memory copy operations, ensure that the source and destination do not overlap. If there is any possibility of overlap, use `memmove` instead of `memcpy`, as `memmove` is designed to handle overlapping regions safely. Additionally, add explicit null checks for the source pointer before performing the copy to avoid null pointer dereference.\n\n```cpp\nif (scale_bias_addr != nullptr) {\n    memmove(&scale, scale_bias_addr, sizeof(float));\n}\n```\n\n## References\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n\n___\n"

There is no evidence of a guard or check to prevent overlap, and the source may also be null, which further increases the risk of undefined behavior.

If overlap is possible, use `std::memmove` instead of `std::memcpy`, as `memmove` is designed to handle overlapping regions safely. For example, replace the original call with:\n\n```cpp\nstd::memmove(tmpDest, B + (acbr_block * colBlockSize + idx + kt * colTileSize) * ldb + j, rem);\n```\n\nAlternatively, add logic to verify that the source and destination do not overlap before copying. This can be done by checking the addresses and ranges of the buffers.

                "markdown": "## Description\n\n\"Detected Prohibited C Function\" vulnerability in C++ programming language refers to the use of certain C standard library functions that are known to be dangerous due to their potential to cause buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other problems. One such function is `printf`.\n\nThe `printf` function is a common function in C and C++ for outputting text. However, it can be dangerous if used improperly, especially when handling user-supplied input. This is because `printf` can interpret certain special characters (like `%s`, `%d`, etc.) and if an attacker can control the format string, they can potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code, read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, or cause the program to crash.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using `printf` with user-supplied input. Instead, use safer alternatives that do not interpret format strings, such as `puts` or `fputs`. If you need to format strings, use functions like `snprintf` that limit the amount of output, and always use a static format string.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_input = get_user_input();\nprintf(user_input);\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_input = get_user_input();\nputs(user_input);\n```\n\nOr, if you need to format strings:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_input = get_user_input();\nchar buffer[256];\nsnprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%s\", user_input);\nputs(buffer);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code examples above require the following library:\n\n```cpp\n#include <stdio.h>\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)"

In this case, the `fopen` function is used, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the file name is not properly validated or if the file is not properly handled after opening.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use safer alternatives to these functions, validate all inputs, and handle errors properly. In the case of `fopen`, consider using a safer alternative such as `fopen_s` (in C11 or later), or use C++ file I/O operations instead.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a recommended fix using C++ file I/O operations:\n\n```cpp\n#include <fstream>\n\nstd::string filename = getCodeLoggingFile<instSet>(accum, mc, nc, nBlock, kBlock, mRegBlockSize, nRegBlockSize);\nstd::ofstream codeLogfile(filename);\nif (!codeLogfile) {\n    // Handle error\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following libraries:\n\n- `<fstream>` for file I/O operations in C++.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)\n\nPlease note that the links provided are accessible to anonymous users at the time of writing this report."

The problem is that the returned pointer might be invalidated or the associated string storage might be overwritten by another call to `getenv`.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nAvoid using `std::getenv` function.

If you must use `std::getenv`, ensure that you handle the returned pointer carefully to avoid potential issues.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\n```cpp\nchar* value = std::getenv(\"FBGEMM_NO_AUTOVEC\");\nif (value == nullptr) {\n    // Handle the case where the environment variable is not set.\n} else {\n    std::string env_val = std::string(value);\n    // Use env_val safely here.\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first check if the returned pointer is `nullptr`. If it is, we handle the case where the environment variable is not set. If it is not `nullptr`, we convert the C string to a `std::string` immediately to avoid potential issues with the pointer becoming invalidated or the string storage being overwritten.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `<cstdlib>`: for `std::getenv`\n- `<string>`: for `std::string`\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)\n\nPlease note that the links provided are valid and active for anonymous users at the time of writing this report."

The code uses a memory copy function with source and destination expressions that may refer to overlapping memory, as indicated by data flow analysis. This can result in unpredictable behavior or data corruption. Additionally, there are no explicit checks or guards to ensure that the source and destination do not overlap, and the source pointer may also be null, which further increases the risk. The destination buffer is a pointer type, and its capacity is not known, which means there is no evidence that the operation is safe. The source is a general identifier, not a string literal or constant, so the risk of overlap is not reduced by the nature of the source. All these factors contribute to a high confidence in the presence of a real issue.\n\n## In Context Remediation\nTo prevent undefined behavior when copying memory regions that may overlap, use a function that is safe for overlapping memory, such as `memmove`, instead of `memcpy`. `memmove` is specifically designed to handle overlapping source and destination regions safely.\n\n```cpp\nmemmove(dst, src, G * kernel_prod * OC_per_G * IC_per_G * sizeof(inpType));\n```\n\nAlternatively, ensure by code logic or explicit checks that the source and destination buffers do not overlap before calling `memcpy`. If overlap is not possible by design, document this assumption clearly in the code and add assertions if feasible.\n\n## References\n- [OWASP C-Based Toolchain Hardening Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)\n- [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n\n___\n"

In this case, the `fopen` function is used, which can lead to vulnerabilities if the file path is not properly validated or controlled.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use safer alternatives to these functions, or to use these functions in a way that their risks are mitigated. For `fopen`, it is important to ensure that the file path is properly validated and controlled, and that error checking is performed.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a safer way to use `fopen`:\n\n```cpp\nstd::string filePath = getCodeLoggingFile<instSet>(accum, stride, mRegBlockSize, nRegBlockSize);\nif(filePath.empty()) {\n    // Handle error\n    return;\n}\n\nFILE* codeLogfile = fopen(filePath.c_str(), \"w\");\nif(codeLogfile == NULL) {\n    // Handle error\n    return;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we first check if the file path is empty, and then check if `fopen` returned `NULL`, which indicates an error.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example does not appear to require any specific library dependencies beyond the standard C++ and C libraries.\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP Proactive Controls](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)"
